This project outlines a crypto trading platform. The main method is located in MainUI.java. There are no associated configuration settings with running this platform.

Our team encountered some mishaps with json imports and needed to import 3 .jar files: jcommon, jfreechart, and gson. Any issues running the program due to these imports can be resolved by downloading the appropriate .jar files, and right-clicking on the project in Eclipse > Build Path > Configure Build Path > Libraries > Click ClassPath > Add External JARs... > and uploading the 3 files.
